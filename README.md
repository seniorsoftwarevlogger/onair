Sign that you are busy

Meant to be a wireless sign that lights up when you enter a Zoom call, so that people around you know you are busy. Leverages http://wled.me/ to control the LED strip over WiFi.

Components:
* WeMos D1 Mini with ESP 8266
* Battery Shield for Wemos D1 Mini
* Battery of your choice. I use one from an older smartphone
* WS2812b led strip
